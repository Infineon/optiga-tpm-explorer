## RSA (Client/Server) 

The RSA(Client/Server) is a demonstration of the hardening of the TLS session between a Client/Endpoint and Server/Cloud the OpenSSL S_Server and S_Client modules will be used along with the local host capability of Linux running on Raspberry Pi® 3B+/4.

TLS provides authenticated key exchange using asymmetric cryptography, data confidentiality using symmetric encryption and message integrity using message authentication codes scheme. However, these crypto primitives are stored in system memory and do not provide any trustworthiness assurance of the involved endpoint.

The drawback is that their implementation is using software library modules that store private keys in

application or secure memory and have proven to contain bugs or vulnerabilities which have been exploited for

the last several years.

The benefit of using SLx 9670 TPM2.0 to protect the private key involved in the TLS handshake process.

# Data Sealing with Policy

This section shows you the Data Sealing with Policy in the OPTIGA™ TPM. It can be used to seal data using a PCR policy.

Sealing permits the key or secret to be protected not only by a password but by a policy. A typical policy locks the key to PCR values (the software state) current at the time of sealing. This assumes that the state at first boot is not compromised. Any preinstalled malware present at first boot would be measured into the PCRs, and thus the key would be sealed to a compromised software state.

# Attestation

This section shows you how to use Attestation in the OPTIGA™ TPM. A system health check supported by Infineon's OPTIGA™ TPM lets users check that their devices have not been manipulated. The TPM provides a secured identity and storage space for system control mechanisms that may check whether hardware and software are still running as intended. The system notifies the user if it does detect changes, e.g. caused by malware.

Go back to the main screen and select "Attestation".

Figure 132: OpenSSL-Engine Attestation Main Screen



## Attestation Function Description

A TPM attestation offers cryptographic proof of software state. The attestation is a TPM quote: a number of PCR are hashed, and that hash is signed by a TPM key known as attestation key. If the remote party can validate that the signing key came from an authentic TPM, it can be assured that the PCR digest report has not been altered. The device remote attestation supported by Infineon's OPTIGA™ TPM lets users check that their devices have not been manipulated to establish the trust in the devices.

# <a name="secured-connection-to-aws-iot-core-using-tpm2.0"></a>Secured connection to AWS IoT core using TPM2.0

AWS IoT core makes use of X.509 certificates to authenticate client or device connections during a registration and onboading attempt.

The "Application: Cloud Connectivity" demo example showcases how to set up trusted connection to AWS IoT core using X.509 with a TPM2.0 private key. The demo software was developed using the AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C, integrating OPTIGA™ TPM2.0 into the platform.

This section explains the following steps required to run the demo
1.  Get started with AWS IoT core
2.  Create device certificate and assign it to Thing with policy
3.  Publish messages to AWS IoT core from the Raspberry Pi

Go back to the main screen and select "Application: Cloud Connectivity".

## Create device certificate and assign it to Thing with policy

Once configuration is done, to provision the certificate, select "1-click provision". Step 1 to Step 6 will be run and a certificate will be generated after receiving the CSR based on keys generated in the TPM, using AWS IoT's certificate authority.

The following code will be run for Step 1 to Step 6.

```
Step 1: Generate a new key pair from TPM2.0 and export the public key.

(/'/>/>/>/',/'tpm2tss-genkey -o owner123 -a rsa rsa.tss/')

Step 2: Generate a Certificate Signing Request

(/'/>/>/>/', u/'openssl req -new -config temp.conf -engine tpm2tss -key rsa.tss -keyform engine -subj/CN=AWS_IoT_TPM_Certificate/O=Infineon_Technologies/C=SG/ST=Singapore -out leaf.csr/')

Step 3: Create AWS IoT Thing

(/'/>/>/>/', u/'aws iot create-thing/--thing-name TPM_UI_Demo/')

Step 4: AWS IoT constructs a new certificate based on the CSR and signs it with the ATS endpoint CA

(/'/>/>/>/',/'aws iot create-certificate-from-csr/--certificate-signing-request file://leaf.csr/--set-as-active/--certificate-pem-outfile leafAWS.crt/')

Step 5: Attach AWS IoT Certificate to AWS IoT Thing

(/'/>/>/>/', u/'aws iot attach-thing-principal/--thing-name TPM_UI_Demo/--principal arn:aws:iot:us-east-2:065398228892:cert/2e3ee116ee7927525e106b3a9579e83e6b879921200fcf056d132be3ea42d623/')

Step 6: The policy is attached to the received certificate

(/'/>/>/>/', u/'aws iot attach-policy/--policy-name IoT_Publish_Subscribe/--target arn:aws:iot:us-east-2:065398228892:cert/2e3ee116ee7927525e106b3a9579e83e6b879921200fcf056d132be3ea42d623/')
```
